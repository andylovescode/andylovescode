# `hello, world!`

Hi! I make stuff, because it makes me happy.

## Stuff I have made

I'll admit, this list is shorter than I'd like it to be, for two main reasons:
1. I don't want to reveal my alt account with some of my other cool projects on it
2. I have high standards for what I consider cool enough to be put here

## Stuff that I've made that may be open sourced in the future
